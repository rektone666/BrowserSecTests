# BrowserSecTests
BrowserSecTests is just a small python experiment tool for lazy people like me which automatically execute a series of security test of your browser .
those test are focused to check how and what data can or cannot be retrived from our browser by simply visiting a page . 
it goes through 75 differts test , from VBScript, COOKIES and so on ... all thanks browserspy.dk ... 
This is the frist version , its huge , dirty and relativily slow ... for now support only Chrome and Chormium ... 


---------------------
# How to use 

for now is pretty straightforward : 

```Python
python3 BrowserSecTests.py >> Output.txt 

```
